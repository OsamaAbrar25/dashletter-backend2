## Dashletter Backend

This is the backend section which will provide the data to the APP, basically this is the API.

### Setup

To setup this application on the server do the following:

* Install node, npm, expressjs:
    - `sudo apt install node.js npm`
    - `npm install express`
* Once all the dependecies are installed just start the server by running:
    - `node server.js`

These are the setup for the ubuntu system but should stay same for most of the general distros.
